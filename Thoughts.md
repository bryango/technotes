# Thoughts

Here we collect some random thoughts.

## dynamics & time derivatives

- Usually, dynamical EoMs are >= 2nd order in time. The initial data is given by the position $x$ and the momentum $p\sim\dot{x}$, upon which one can construct a phase space endowed with a symplectic structure.
- Schrodinger & Dirac equation are 1st order in time. However, a phase space is still present because the initial data $\psi$ is complex. In these cases we actually have a coupled system of 1st order equations, which can be re-written into 2nd order ones.
